# This file contains the code for the negotiation server that will be run on computer A. 
# The server will handle the negotiation process with Robot B to determine the optimal speed for both robots. 
# The server will receive proposals from Robot B, propose speeds to Robot B, and respond to proposals from Robot B. 
# The negotiation process will continue until a mutually acceptable speed is reached by both robots.
# Import necessary libraries
import requests

# Define constants

ROBOT_B_URL = 'http://<robot_b_ip>:5000'  # Replace <robot_b_ip> with the actual IP address of Robot B
